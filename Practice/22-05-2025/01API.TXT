An API (Application Programming Interface) in Node.js facilitates communication between different software systems. 
Node.js, with its asynchronous and event-driven architecture, is well-suited for building scalable and efficient APIs, 
particularly RESTful APIs. These APIs commonly use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
Express.js is a popular framework that simplifies the process of creating APIs in Node.js 
by providing tools for routing, middleware, and request handling.

To create an API in Node.js using Express: Set up a Node.js project.

Code

    npm init -y
    npm install express


Create an Express app.

    JavaScript

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON request bodies

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });

Define API routes.
    
    JavaScript

    app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
      // Handle GET request for all users
      res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane Smith' }]);
    });

    app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
     // Handle POST request to create a new user
      const newUser = req.body;
      // Save the new user to a database or in-memory storage
      res.status(201).json(newUser); // Respond with the created user and status code 201
    });

Handle requests and responses:
Use req (request) object to access request data (e.g., parameters, body, headers).
Use res (response) object to send responses (e.g., data, status codes, headers).

Implement middleware:
Middleware functions can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.

Connect to a database (optional):
Use libraries like Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for SQL databases) to interact with databases.

Test the API:
Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.
