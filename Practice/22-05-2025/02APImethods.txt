HTTP methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, are essential for web development, 
enabling communication between clients and servers. These methods define the actions 
a client requests the server to perform on a resource.

### Here's a breakdown of each method:

**GET**:  
- Retrieves data from the server.  
- It's considered a safe operation as it doesn't modify the server's state.  
- GET requests can be cached by browsers, making them efficient for repeated requests.

**POST**:  
- Sends data to the server to create a new resource or submit data.  
- It's often used for forms and creating new entries in a database.  
- POST requests are not cached and can have side effects on the server.

**PUT**:  
- Replaces an existing resource entirely.  
- The server receives the entire updated data, and if successful, the resource is 
  completely overwritten.

**DELETE**:  
- Removes a resource from the server.  
- It requests that the server delete the association between the target resource and 
  its functionality.

**PATCH**:  
- Partially updates a resource.  
- It allows for sending a change to only the specific part of a resource, rather than 
  replacing the entire resource like PUT.

These methods, along with others like **OPTIONS**, **HEAD**, and **TRACE**, form the 
core of how web clients interact with web servers, enabling data retrieval, 
modification, and creation.
