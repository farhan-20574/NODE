Hereâ€™s the code snippet to assign a grade based on the user's percentage:

```javascript
// User's percentage
let percentage = 85; // Change this value to test different grades

// Determine the grade
if (percentage >= 90) {
    console.log("A Grade");
} else if (percentage >= 80) {
    console.log("B Grade");
} else if (percentage >= 70) {
    console.log("C Grade");
} else if (percentage >= 60) {
    console.log("D Grade");
} else {
    console.log("F Grade");
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **`percentage`**: A variable that holds the user's percentage.
2. **Conditions**:
   - If the percentage is **90 or above**, the user gets an **A Grade**.
   - If the percentage is **80 or above but less than 90**, the user gets a **B Grade**.
   - If the percentage is **70 or above but less than 80**, the user gets a **C Grade**.
   - If the percentage is **60 or above but less than 70**, the user gets a **D Grade**.
   - If the percentage is **less than 60**, the user gets an **F Grade**.

You can test the code by changing the value of `percentage`. Let me know if you need further assistance!
